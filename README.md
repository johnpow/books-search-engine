# Books Search Engine

## Description
This project is a book search engine that allows users to search for new books to read and keep a list of books to purchase. It was originally built as a fully functioning Google Books API search engine using a RESTful API. The challenge is to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, while utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
